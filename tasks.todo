Chat Application Todo List:
    Core Functionality:
        ✔ Group message: Allow passing public messages
        ✔ Private message: Allow passing private messages with the format /w [name] [message]
        ✔ Make names unique: Ensure usernames are unique across all connected clients @done(24-07-10 09:51)
        ✔ Validate username: If username is less than 2 char or empty, retry 3 times
        ✔ Add timestamps to messages for better context
        ✔ Reply functionality: Implement reply functionality with /reply [message] @started(24-07-10 09:51) @done(24-07-10 10:11) @lasted(20m24s)
        ✔ Client re-establish connection with exponential retry @done(24-07-14 15:38)
    User Interface:
        ✔ Send messages from server with prefix (MSG, WSP)
        ✔ Display allowed commands when someone joins. This should be handled on client side. @started(24-07-15 00:04) @done(24-07-15 00:32) @lasted(28m41s)
        ☐ Client errors should have "Client:" prefix with a different color
        ✔ Implement Active User display: @done(24-07-15 15:44)
        ```
        Active Users (25): Alice, Bob, Charlie [+22 more] (Use /users for full list)
        ----------------------------------
        [Chat messages appear here]
        ----------------------------------
        Your message:
        ```

    Chat History:
        ☐ Implement /history command
        ☐ Store chat history for late-joining clients (limit to ~100 messages)
        ☐ Server should persist history to file and restore on restart
        ☐ Implement full-text search for chat history
    Protocol and Security:
        ✔ Add Protocol
        ✔ Implement protocol: Client read
        ✔ Implement protocol: Server sent
        ✔ Implement protocol: Client sent @done(24-07-07 12:38)
        ✔ Implement protocol: Server read @done(24-07-07 12:38)
        ☐ Message encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption using golang.org/x/crypto
    Advanced Features:
        Chatrooms:
            ☐ Allow users to create and join different chatrooms
            ☐ Allow clients to switch between private chats and group chat
            ☐ Implement commands: /create, /join, /leave
        Presence System:
            ☐ Show user statuses (online, away, busy, etc.)
            ☐ Allow users to set custom status messages
        Typing Indicators:
            ☐ Show when other users are typing
            ☐ Implement in a non-intrusive way in the terminal UI
        Command System:
            ☐ Create a robust command system (e.g., /help, /mute, /unmute, /block)
        Notification System:
        ☐   Notify users of mentions or important messages when not actively viewing chat
        Active User Management:
            ☐ Server: Maintain list/map of all active users
            ☐ Server: Send updates with total count and subset of names
            ☐ Client: Store full list of users
            ☐ Client: Implement /users command to show full list
        Performance and Security:
            ☐ Implement rate limiting to prevent spam and abuse
    Bug Fixes:
        ✔ Fix: Server locks when two users join simultaneously
        ✔ Check whisper logic: Ensure robustness and correctness
        ✔ When client reconnects after successful connection it required one more extra input before sending username. @done(24-07-14 16:04)
            Make sure all goroutines are closed before retrying using waitGroups and additional channel called done @Solution
